## Project Structure

# Images Directory

This directory is for storing website images.

## Currently Using

The website currently uses placeholder images from [placehold.co](https://placehold.co/) with the following specifications:

- Home page showcase: 600x400px
- About page image: 600x800px
- Team member photos: 300x300px
- Location map: 1200x400px

## Recommendations for Real Images

When replacing placeholder images with real content:

1. Use the same dimensions for consistency
2. Optimize all images for web (compress to reduce file size)
3. Include alternative text for accessibility
4. Consider using WebP format for better performance
5. Add responsive image sizes when possible
